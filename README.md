# JavaBlockchain
A blockchain application written in Java.

Improved version of the application written by [Kass on Medium.com](https://medium.com/programmers-blockchain/create-simple-blockchain-java-tutorial-from-scratch-6eeed3cb03fa).

## Features
* Unlimited data-size.
* Clean and simple implentation of a blockchain *without* currency/payments as main-feature.
* No proof-of-work system. (Just submit a block with valid hash)

## ToDo
* Simple http server for sending and receiving generated blocks.
* Plain-text block storage within the file-system.

### Side-notes
* Valid block hashes start with at least 2 zeros.
* Everything is still a work-in-progress and probably will be in the upcoming months.
