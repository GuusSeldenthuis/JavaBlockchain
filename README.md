# JavaBlockchain
A blockchain application written in Java.

Improved version of the application written by [Kass on Medium.com](https://medium.com/programmers-blockchain/create-simple-blockchain-java-tutorial-from-scratch-6eeed3cb03fa).

## Features
* Unlimited data-size.
* Clean and simple implentation of a blockchain *without* currency/payments as main-feature.
* Simple difficulty system for mining the right block-hash. (To be removed)

## ToDo
* No proof-of-work system. (Just submit a block with valid hash)
* Simple http server for sending and receiving generated blocks.
* Plain-text block storage within the file-system.
